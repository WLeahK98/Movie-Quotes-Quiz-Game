### Issues:
* Im not used to coding with Javascript so at points I was honestly confused with the code, I had to use the help from different YouTube tutorials so I only could come up with four quotes prompts as I didnt want to get confused further.
* I wanted to add an image or gif that would display a giff or image from the movie/anime when answere is selected to show the correct show/film as well as add more fun and interactiveness to the game but will have to re-visit that idea another time.
